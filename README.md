  - `api/`: Tenant-specific API routes.
- `components/`: Shared React components, including a rich `ui` library based on shadcn/ui.
- `lib/`: Core logic, utilities, database client (Prisma), auth configuration, and service integrations.
- `prisma/`: Database schema (`schema.prisma`) and migration history.
- `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for shared client-side logic (e.g., course progress, confetti).
- `messages/`: Internationalization (i18n) translation files for English and Arabic.
- `middleware.ts`: The heart of the multi-tenancy and i18n routing, responsible for URL rewriting and locale detection.
